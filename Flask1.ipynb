    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a micro-framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries, and it has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of Flask are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework, which means it has a small code base and doesn't require much setup or configuration. This makes it easy to get started with and reduces the overhead of building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask provides a lot of flexibility in terms of how you can structure your application and what components you use. This means you can build your application the way you want, using the components that make the most sense for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn: Flask has a simple and intuitive API that is easy to learn, even for beginners. It is also well-documented, with a large community of users and developers who can provide support and guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: Flask is highly extensible and can be easily customized to meet your specific needs. It provides a lot of hooks and extension points that allow you to add new functionality and integrate with other tools and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal for small to medium-sized applications: Flask is ideal for building small to medium-sized web applications. It can be used to build more complex applications as well, but it may not be the best choice for very large-scale applications due to its lightweight nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework that is easy to learn and ideal for building small to medium-sized web applications. Its advantages include its simplicity, flexibility, extensibility, and strong community support.\n",
